## Name 
Animal Processing
## Exercise requirements
* Write a getAnimalOutfit() function that:
* * Takes in a single animal object as a parameter
* * Returns a description of their outfit, like "blue pants and red shirt and white heels"
* * Run the function on an array of animals

* Write feedAnimal() function that:
* * Takes in a single animal object as a parameter
* * Prints out what the animal is eating. E.g. "Zebra is eating food3, food1, food4 and food2"
* * The list should be pretty printed: comma separated except for the last food item
* * The order of the food items should be random, but all food items for that animal should appear
* * Run the function on an array of animals
## Approch to the solution
I created the two functions using the old exercise code.
