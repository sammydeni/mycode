## Name 
Clothed Animals
## Exercise requirements
* Add an "outfit" property to each animal, which describes different parts of their outfit using
different properties, for example, "shirt": "blue"
* Outfit should have at least 3 properties.
* Output the properties of each animal as key and value pairs. Nested properties should be nicely
formatted
* Now try to formulate a more descriptive output. E.g "bamby is wearing a blue shirt and red pants
and a green hat"
## Approch to the solution
I added the outfit property to the objects.
I used JSON.stringify to format the objects.
