## Name 
Music Video
## Exercise requirements
* Use the Video object from the previous exercise.
* Create a new object called MusicVideo that extends Video. Its constructor should
also take in an artist argument.
* Instantiate a new MusicVideo object and call the watch() method on it.
* Add a method to MusicVideo called rockOut() that uses console.log to output a
string like "You rocked out to La Bamba by Ritchie Valens!.
* Use an array of data and a for loop to instantiate 5 MusicVideo objects.
* Make an array of video data with both normal videos and music videos, loop
through them, and decide on each one whether to make it a Video or MusicVideo
object.
