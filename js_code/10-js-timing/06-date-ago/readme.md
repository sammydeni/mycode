## Name 
Date Ago

## Exercise requirements
* Create a function getDateAgo(date, days) that returns the day of the month n
days ago from the given date.
* For instance, if today is the 20th, then getDateAgo(new Date(), 1) should be 19th
and getDateAgo(new Date(), 2) should be 18th.
* The function should work reliably with any valid Date object. Test it.
## Approch to the solution
I used a lot of Date object proprieties to do this exercise.
