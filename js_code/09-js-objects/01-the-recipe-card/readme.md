## Name 
The recipe Card

## Exercise requirements
* Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).
* On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information
* Bonus: Create an array that holds several recipes and log them all

## Approch to the solution
I created the object and then printed it with the console.log
