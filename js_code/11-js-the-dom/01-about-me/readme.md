About Me
## Exercise requirements
* Change the body style so it has a font-family of "Arial, sans-serif"
* Replace each of the spans (nickname, favorites, hometown) with your own information
* Iterate through each li and change the class to "list-item"
* Create a new img element and set its src attribute to a picture of you
* Append that element to the page
## Approch to the solution
I use DOM methods to do this exercise.

## Files
