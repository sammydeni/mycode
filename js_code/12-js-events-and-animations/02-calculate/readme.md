## Exercise requirements
* Add inputs for half number, percentage and circle area
* Use the functions from the previous calculator exercises
* For each operation, create an event listener for the button, and when it's clicked,
find the value of the appropriate input and show the result of the calculation in
the solution div
* Afterwards, change the code so that you respond to key presses so that the user
doesn't have to click the button
## Approch to the solution
I used the event listeners to print the results of the function when the button is clicked;
