## Name 
United Nations

## Exercise requirements
* Make a <ul> list of countries
* * Each list item should contain: the flag, the name and the population number
* * The name should be left aligned and the population should be right aligned
* * Countries with large populations should be highlighted in some way
* * The flags area should have a background color
* * If the flag is not rectangular (e.g. Switzerland) the flag should be centered in the flag area
* * Include at least one country with an irregularly sized flag (e.g Switzerland)
* * The list should contain at least 50 countries and should be scrollable
## Approach to solution
I created a dynamic page that use json files to get the country information.
I used the API https://www.countryflags.io/ to get the Flag images.

## Files
* [Index](index.html) 
* [Style](style/style.css) 
* [JS](script/main.js)
